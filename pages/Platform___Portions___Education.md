- The Educational portion of our SKF Platform is intended for career practitioners, researchers, and developers interested in Security, in some aspect (we aim to have a little bit for everyone).
	- All of the content checked into the Educational portion of our SKF Platform undergoes evaluation for adherence to the [SKF Content Guidelines]([[Platform/Portions/Education/Content Guidelines]]), unless it's authored directly by SKF.
		- Content produced by SKF is checked for accuracy, quality, and presentation by the SKF Core team.
- Certain courses are meant to be offered Free-of-Cost; mainly these are introductory courses such as David Wheeler's [Secure Development course (OSSF)]([[Graph/Courses/Secure Development (OSSF)]]).
	- We really don't want to have an excessive amount of Free-of-Cost, as rarely can we offer a course without adding some additional overhead.
		- Perhaps 2-3 courses
